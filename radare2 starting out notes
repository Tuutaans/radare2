to enable debugger use: r2 -d filename
and analyze the binary: r2 -A filename
			or aaa after debugging the file and in r2 console.

always enabe sandboxed mode for safety.
to enable: r2 -e cfg.sandbox=true

to list all functions: afl

to disassemble function: pdf @ function_name (space doesn't matter)

to get info about the file: i
to show all the info of the file: iA

to get every strings in the binary: izz ( helpful to get strings/text available in the binary and saves us from converting to ascii from other encoding)
demo:
[0x7f108f00b119]> izz

to print out current memory address: s
to query related to navigate through memory: s?

to run system command without any error or fail: !	e.g: !clear

to see graph or enter visual mode: V, VV

to set breakpoints: db memoryaddress (We set breakpoints to analyze what is going on the current memory addres, value it stores etc.)

to continue execution of the program: dc

to stepover one line or n line: ds
for any query related to disassemble use: d?, ds?, dc?

to print hexdump of memory address or functions: px switch
for any query related to print use: p?

to write a string to the current memory addres: w
for any confusion related to write command use: w?

demo:
	pdf @ main
pdf = print disassemblery function
@ = THis symbol is used to specify something in an address in memory
pdf is used toi disassemble and @ is used to denote main function address.
